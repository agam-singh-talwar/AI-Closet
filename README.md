Welcome to AI clauset, your personal helper to select your day to day outfits. We invite you to complete a little walkthrough below to see the key features of our application. It will show what our application is currently capable of as well as how it utilizes AI in its work.

**Please do the walkthough in the incognito window as some of the addons might block the fetches to AI.**

### Account Creation
Let's start our journey with signup. On the Home page on the top left corner click SignUp button.

On the appeared form you are asked for "your name", "email" and "password". Fill out those fields with corresponding information and click "Create my account".

Mock examples of information that you can input:
- "Your name": "Alex"
- "Email": "alex@email.com"
- "Password": "12345"

After you have created account, you should see the main page of the application with your name on top.

### Adding Clothes (AI used)
You won't see any outfits on the Home page as you don't have any clothes. Let's add some.
You have an option to click "+" button in the bottom right corner on the home page OR go to "[My Wardrobe](https://ai-clauset.vercel.app/wardrobe)" in the navbar and click "Add New Cloth" button at the bottom of the page.

Option 1 (Click "+" button):

Option 2 (Click "Add New Cloth" button):
![add](https://github.com/dps970/final-project-mdmytrenko-astalwar/assets/79389256/e6e6ecdb-aaeb-4a90-82ac-b9197b6a877f)

In any case you will be presented with a modal asking you to enter cloth information.
All fields are required and you are asked to upload a cloth image, enter its name, enter an occasion for which you feel comfortable wearing this cloth and enter a temperature under which you feel comfortable wearing this cloth.

**AI USED** You can witness the use of AI when you appload an image of an item.
After some small amount of time as you upload an image of a cloth, you will see that cloth type whether its "Top" or "Bottom" was identified. Note: auto detection only works for .png and .jpg images.
